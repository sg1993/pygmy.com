The following tests/experiments are newly added:

* Cache latency/consistency tests: https://github.com/ds-umass/lab-3-lab-3-george-raghavan/blob/master/tests/test/CacheTests.java
* Tests to verify Fault-tolerance and recovery: https://github.com/ds-umass/lab-3-lab-3-george-raghavan/blob/master/tests/test/FaultToleranceTests.java

To see how to run these tests, check out the "Running experiments" subsection of "How to run?" section of the [Design Document](https://github.com/ds-umass/lab-3-lab-3-george-raghavan/blob/master/docs/DesignDoc.pdf)
